# Collatz Conjecture Visualization and Analysis

This project provides a Python implementation of the Collatz Conjecture, including visualization of the sequence, an iterative solution, and an optimized solution using memoization.

## Features

- **Visualization**: Generates a graph of the Collatz sequence for a given number using Matplotlib.
- **Iterative Solution**: Calculates the number of steps to reach 1 using an iterative approach.
- **Optimized Solution**: Uses memoization to optimize the calculation of steps for the Collatz Conjecture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- tqdm (for progress bar)

Install the required library using:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Largest Numbers and Stop Time by Date

This section documents the largest numbers encountered during the exploration of the Collatz Conjecture and the corresponding stop times. The stop time refers to the number of steps required to reach 1 for a given starting number.
### Example Records

- 2025-04-16:
Largest Number - 63728127 
Stop Time - 950
Elapsed Time - 725 sec.

Tracking these values helps analyze patterns and performance of the implemented solutions.
