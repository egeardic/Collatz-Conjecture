# Collatz Conjecture Visualization and Analysis

This project provides a Python implementation of the Collatz Conjecture, including visualization of the sequence, an iterative solution, and an optimized solution using memoization.

## Features

- **Visualization**: Generates a graph of the Collatz sequence for a given number using Matplotlib.
- **Iterative Solution**: Calculates the number of steps to reach 1 using an iterative approach.
- **Optimized Solution**: Uses memoization to optimize the calculation of steps for the Collatz Conjecture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- tqdm (for progress bar)

Install the required library using pip:
